# IDS2021FallCapstone
Final Capstone project for NYU's Intro to Data Science course, done in the Fall 2021 semester.

This repository contains 3 things: a CSV containing the raw data used in this project, some .IPYNB files used to encode the
analysis done in this project, and a text document reporting the conclusions.
